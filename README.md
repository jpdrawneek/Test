Test App
====

Clone repo and run index.html in chrome to use the app.

Basic instructions on how to use the application are included in the UI.

Test runner is under tests/jasmine-standalone-2.0.0/SpecRunner.html and will run in chrome.

Built in JavaScript due to the requirements originally given.

10p and 5p are not included in this app due to the requirements stating that only £2, £1, 50p, 20p, 2p and 1p coins are to be accounted for.
The app can easily be extended to use 10p and 5p due to its design with extra test cases.

Improvements
===
Use of an autoloader as the number of dependant files are starting to add up.

Allow nicer configuration of parsing inputs and validation rules.

Abstract out Handlebars to make it swappable and mockable.

More test coverage of UI.
